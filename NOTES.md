## Large files
Large files, or "large assets", on the other hand, are giant blobs of data encoded in a specific file format and measured in kilo, mega, or gigabytes. As a simple rule:

- If it makes sense to go into an excel spreadsheet, it probably belongs in a traditional database
- If it would normally be stored on your hard drive as its own file, it probably is a "large file"
